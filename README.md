<h2>Neural net from scratch</h2>
<p>This project is my attempt at creating a feedforward neural net from scratch. Written in C++.</p>
<h3>Logbook/Diary type stuff:</h3>
<p>2021/7/27 - I decided to add the output file from the training data reader to the repository. I sort of gave up on trying to use the zlib-header to read the training data and resorted to using the boost library. For now I want to move my focus back onto the neural net. I'll look more into what went wrong with trying to implement the zlib functions later. I also dabbled with bitwise operations for the first time in a long time, and noticed that I need more practice on that, so I'll be looking into that tomorrow.</p>
