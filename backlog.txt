1. Getting the model to work
-Get the biases to converge (they are approaching infinite values atm)


2. Making the model usable for more tasks
-Add info on the number of layers into saveModel
-Add info on the number of nodes in each layer into saveModel
-Make the number of layers, weights and nodes dynamic, to allow for models of
 different sizes to be created.
